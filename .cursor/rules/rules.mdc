# Cursor Rules

## Rule Types
- Project Rules: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` - version-controlled, scoped to codebase
- User Rules: Settings > Rules - global to Cursor
- Memories: Auto-generated from conversations (beta)
- Legacy: `.cursorrules` (deprecated)

## Rule Behavior
- Always: Always in context
- Auto: Attached when files match glob pattern
- Agent: AI decides (needs description)
- Manual: Use @ruleName to include

## Creating Rules
1. `Cmd + Shift + P` > "New Cursor Rule"
2. Or Settings > Rules
3. Or `/Generate Cursor Rules` in chat

## Rule Structure
```mdc

globs: [patterns]

- First rule
- Second rule
@example-file.ts
```

## Best Practices
- Keep under 500 lines
- Split complex rules
- Include examples
- Be specific
- Reuse common rules
